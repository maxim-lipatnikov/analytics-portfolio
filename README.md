# Maxim Lipatnikov - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hi, I'm Max! I am a seasoned Data Analyst with a proven track record in the FinTech sector, specializing in the management and analysis of intricate banking data for a user base exceeding 30 million. Having recently relocated to Israel, I'm currently looking for opportunities to utilize my existing skills and develop new ones.

My academic background includes a bachelor's degree in Business Informatics from the National Research University Higher School of Economics, which is one of the top universities in Russia. Studying on the "Business-Informatics" program equipped me with a well-rounded skill set in product development, management, data management, and programming.

This GitHub portfolio serves as a comprehensive showcase of my capabilities, encompassing a diverse range of skills, relevant courses, university projects, and tangible examples of my contributions to real-world projects. It reflects my commitment to a data-driven approach and my proficiency in utilizing tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau.
